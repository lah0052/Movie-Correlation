# Movie Correlation
Used Python3 within Jupyter Notebooks used data visualization to correlate the data from the movies database.
Converted the gross and budget columns to type int64 so correlation functions would work and we could look at the correlation of the two.
A heatmap which shows the correlation between all columns was made using seaborn.
Then the correlations are gone through and the highest correlated columns are displayed.
