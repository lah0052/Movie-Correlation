# Movie Correlation
Used Python3 within Jupyter Notebooks I use data visualization to correlate the data from the movies database.
I changed the gross and budget columns to tyep int64 so we can look at the correlation of the two and for the later correlation heatmap
Then the correlations are gone through and the highest correlated columns are displayed.
