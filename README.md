# Movie Correlation
Used Python3 within Jupyter Notebooks where I used data visualization to correlate the data from the movies database.
Converted the gross and budget columns to type int64 so correlation functions would work.
A heatmap which shows the correlation between all columns was made using seaborn.
Then the correlations are gone through and the highest correlated columns are displayed.
